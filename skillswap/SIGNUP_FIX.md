# Fix SignUp Email Confirmation Issue

## The Problem

Your Supabase project likely has email confirmation enabled, which means users must verify their email before they can sign in.

## Solution: Disable Email Confirmation (For Development)

### Step 1: Access Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to [https://app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Select your SkillSwap project
3. Navigate to **Authentication** > **Settings**

### Step 2: Disable Email Confirmation

1. Scroll down to **"Email Confirmation"**
2. **Turn OFF** the toggle for "Enable email confirmations"
3. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Test Signup

1. Go to http://localhost:5173/signup
2. Try creating a new account
3. You should now be able to sign up without email verification

## Alternative: Enable Email Confirmation (Production Ready)

If you want to keep email confirmation enabled:

1. **Set up email templates** in Supabase Dashboard
2. **Configure SMTP settings** for email delivery
3. Users will receive confirmation emails and must click the link
